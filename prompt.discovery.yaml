title: Perform Full Technical Assessment for project-name
persona: CodeAuditor
category: analysis
difficulty: hard

context: |
  This prompt conducts a full technical assessment of the target project.
  It includes evaluating structure, product scope, architecture, stack, domain entities, testing approach,
  operational risks, and outputs everything to the structured folders under `.guides/`.

dependencies:
  - Full access to the source code
  - Knowledge of Guided Engineering documentation standards
