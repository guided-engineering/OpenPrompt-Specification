title: Setup Canonical .guided Structure and Run Technical Assessment
persona: DocumentationEngineer
category: base
difficulty: hard
workspace: ./
context: |
  This prompt performs two main actions:
  
  1. Creates the canonical `.guided/` folder structure defined by Guided Engineering.
     It initializes all required folders and files (even empty) to ensure consistency and traceability.
  
  2. Executes a full technical assessment of the project, analyzing structure, product scope, architecture,
     stack, entities, testing strategy, and operational risks, and writes the outputs to the corresponding `.guided/` folders.

dependencies:
  - Full access to the source code
  - File system access to `.guided/`
  - Knowledge of Guided Engineering documentation standards
