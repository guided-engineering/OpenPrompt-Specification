title: Generate Onboarding Guide for New Developers
persona: DocumentationEngineer
context: |
  The project includes a structured `.guides/` folder with documentation about the product, architecture, setup, testing, personas, prompts, and assessments.
  This prompt should generate a complete onboarding guide (`onboarding.md`) aimed at helping new developers understand and start contributing to the project effectively.
  The output must be written in Brazilian Portuguese, using clear, welcoming, and technically accurate language.
  Use all relevant `.guides/*` content and Git commit history to construct the guide.
