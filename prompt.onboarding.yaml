title: Generate Onboarding Guide for New Developers
persona: Documentation Specialist
context: |
  The project already has a structured `.guides/` folder containing documentation about the product, architecture, assessments, setup, testing, personas, and more.
  This prompt should generate a comprehensive and welcoming `onboarding.md` file for new developers.
  It should include a table of contents, practical instructions, context, architecture, personas, prompt usage, setup, contribution guidelines, glossary, and a list of actual contributors based on Git history.
