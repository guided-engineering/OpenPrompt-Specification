  We want to create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file to guide GitHub Copilot's behavior in this repository.
  The instructions should reflect the standards, conventions, and folder structure described in `.guides/`, especially the SDLC practices.
  The goal is to help Copilot provide context-aware and structure-aligned suggestions during development.
